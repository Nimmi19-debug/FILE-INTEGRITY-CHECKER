"DESCRIPTION":
Task 1: File Integrity Checker
This project is a web-based File Integrity Checker developed using "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" in "Visual Studio Code". The tool is designed to verify the integrity of files by computing their "SHA-256 hash values" and comparing them with a known or original hash.

The application allows users to upload any file through a simple web interface (`index.html`). Upon file selection, the JavaScript code (`script.js`) reads the file content using the `FileReader` API and generates a SHA-256 hash using the `SubtleCrypto` API. This computed hash is then displayed on the screen and can be manually compared with an original or expected hash to check if the file has been tampered with or altered.
The tool is useful for:
* Detecting unauthorized changes in files
* Verifying downloaded files against official checksums
* Teaching basic file security and hashing concepts
